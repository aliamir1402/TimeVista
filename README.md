# TimeVista
FYP Project

INTRODUCTION

TimeVista is a groundbreaking project that encapsulates over four decades of historical climate data, spanning 1980 to 2022, with a singular focus: revolutionizing Pakistan's agricultural landscape. It aims at unlocking predictive insights into:
extreme weather events
crop yield forecasts
crucial water availability trends

At its core, TimeVista is dedicated to the aggregation, preprocessing, and analysis of diverse historical climate datasets sourced from satellites, weather stations, and other relevant sources. This entails meticulous data cleaning, standardization, and the deployment of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, like LSTM models, to unearth patterns, forecast extreme weather events, predict crop yields, and assess water availability.

Back End Development

Choose a backend technology stack (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Django, Ruby on Rails).
Set up a development environment on your local machine.
Choose a hosting provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku).
Provision a virtual server or container for deploying your backend application.
Install necessary software dependencies, libraries, and packages.
Set up version control using Git for managing your codebase.
Implement continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
Backend Server Setup:
Configure server security settings, including firewalls, SSH access, and HTTPS.
Set up monitoring and logging solutions to track server performance and detect issues.
Configure backups and disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure data safety.
Database Setup:
Choose a database management system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB).
Design the database schema based on your application's data model and requirements.
Set up a development database instance on your local machine.
Choose a database hosting provider or deploy a self-hosted database server.
Provision a database instance or cluster with the required compute and storage resources.
Configure database security settings, including authentication, encryption, and access controls.
Set up database backups and automated snapshots to prevent data loss.


Backend Server Deployment:
Prepare your application for deployment by building optimized production-ready artifacts.
Deploy your backend application to the production server or cloud platform.
Configure domain name settings and DNS records to point to your server's IP address.
Set up SSL/TLS certificates to enable HTTPS encryption for secure communication.
Configure load balancers or reverse proxies for distributing traffic and improving scalability.
Test the deployed application thoroughly to ensure proper functionality and performance.
